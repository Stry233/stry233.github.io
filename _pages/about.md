Yuetian Chen's main interest is in natural language processing and its applications in content generation. In particular, his research focuses on the assistance and performance gains provided by multimodal-based prompt learning for medium-sized language models in enhancing the understanding of computer-assisted interactive narrative tasks. In one example of his work, Yuetian helped develop a [story generation framework utilizing](http://vsg-ek.herokuapp.com/) based on named entities and Plutchik's emotion wheel model. Through users' changes to prompt keywords, the framework can generate relevant and self-consistent story contexts in real time and provides an effective solution for user-controlled co-creation of [story-cloze-style](https://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/) narratives. 

Yuetian also has interdisciplinary development experience in computational biology, the pre-processing strategies of high-dimensional and highly sparse data. In his paper "Automated Cell Recognition using Single-cell RNA Sequencing with Machine Learning", he eases the boundary problem of sc-RNA in dimensionality reduction by creatively fusing T-SNE and PCA and achieved 7% higher classification performance than baseline.
