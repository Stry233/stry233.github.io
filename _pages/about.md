Yuetian Chen is a computer science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/)) with a primary research interest in natural language processing and its applications in content generation. His research is centered on the enhancement of computer-assisted interactive narrative tasks through multimodal-based prompt learning for medium-sized language models.

One of his significant contributions is the development of [a story generation framework](http://vsg-ek.herokuapp.com/) that leverages named entities and [Plutchik's emotion wheel model](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg). This innovative framework can generate relevant and self-consistent story contexts in real time, offering an effective solution for user-controlled co-creation of story-cloze-style narratives. This work showcases Yuetian's ability to apply his knowledge and skills in practical settings, demonstrating his potential as a researcher in the field of content generation in natural language processing.

In addition to his work in natural language processing, Yuetian has also made notable contributions to the field of computational biology. In his paper "Automated Cell Recognition using Single-cell RNA Sequencing with Machine Learning," he addressed the boundary problem of sc-RNA in dimensionality reduction. By ingeniously fusing T-SNE and PCA, Yuetian achieved a 7% higher classification performance than the baseline, demonstrating his innovative approach to handling high-dimensional and highly sparse data.

Yuetian's research endeavors are complemented by his role as a Research Assistant under Professor Mei Si at RPI and his involvement in the Undergraduate Mentor/Teaching Asistant Program in [`CSCI 2600 - Principles of Software`](https://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=15&coid=28170), [`CSCI 2500 - Computer Organization`](https://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=9&coid=14812) and [`PHIL 2140 - Introduction to Logic`](https://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=10&coid=17460) at RPI. These experiences have provided him with valuable insights into the academic and research landscape, further enhancing his research capabilities.

His exceptional academic performance has earned him several honors and awards, including multiple inclusions on the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Dean's Honor List and Academic Recognition Letters from RPI faculty. These accolades underscore Yuetian's dedication to his academic pursuits and his potential for future success in the field of computer science research.
