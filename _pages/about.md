My research area is natural language processing, with a focus on developing and deploying controllable and interactive content generation based on language models. This involves understanding open-world, complex, and multi-modal data, and establishing a further application for deep learning in computational creativity. 

Recently, I have been dedicated to researching security issues of foundational models, including: (1) examining various Membership Inference Attack methods in computer vision tasks, such as Likelihood Ratio Attack and Threshold Attack, dynamically and from the perspective of individual data samples; (2) Adversarial Attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), like Prompt-level Jail Break and Data Poisoning. 

Additionally, I utilize artificial intelligence to deploy human-centric multimodal agent robots, enhancing their interactivity and multi-functionality in diverse environments.

<!-- Yuetian's research endeavors are complemented by his role as a Research Assistant under Professor Mei Si at RPI and his involvement in the Undergraduate Mentor/Teaching Asistant Program in [`CSCI 2600 - Principles of Software`](https://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=15&coid=28170), [`CSCI 2500 - Computer Organization`](https://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=9&coid=14812) and [`PHIL 2140 - Introduction to Logic`](https://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=10&coid=17460) at RPI. These experiences have provided him with valuable insights into the academic and research landscape, further enhancing his research capabilities.

His exceptional academic performance has earned him several honors and awards, including multiple inclusions on the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Dean's Honor List and Academic Recognition Letters from RPI faculty. These accolades underscore Yuetian's dedication to his academic pursuits and his potential for future success in the field of computer science research. -->
