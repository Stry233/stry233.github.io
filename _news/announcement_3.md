The Gameful and Immersive Learning Symposium presents innovative methods and technologies for teaching such as reward systems that encourage engagement, adaptive content that personalizes learning for individual students, and human-scale immersive environments that place students within the materialâ€™s authentic contexts. Using combinations of these can create impactful educational experiences.

This two-day symposium offers invited talks by field experts, panel discussions with Rensselaer community members, and workshops for creating, curating, and facilitating these types of learning experiences. Symposium events are held at EMPAC in both the Theater and in Studio 2, where the immersive panoramic screen is installed.
