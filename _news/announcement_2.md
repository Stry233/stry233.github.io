I am thrilled to announce that I recently had the privilege of participating in the Undergraduate Research Fair at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This event, held at the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, brought together over 30 undergraduate students from various disciplines to present their research findings. As a representative from Professor <a href="https://homepages.rpi.edu/~sim/">Mei Si</a>'s research group, I was among a diverse group of students from 14 different majors, including computer science, earth and environmental science, chemistry, biochemistry and biophysics, etc.

Recently, more than 30 undergraduate students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute gathered at the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies to share their findings with the community.

The undergraduate research fair showcased the work of students from the School of Science, as well as students from other schools who conducted research within the School of Science. Students represented 14 different majors including computer science, earth and environmental science, chemistry, biochemistry and biophysics, physics, mathematics, biology, computational biology, biological neuroscience, computer and system engineering, computer engineering, games and simulation engineering, biomedical engineering, and environmental engineering.

Students presented research on harmful algae blooms, Alzheimer’s disease, microplastics, science communication, cell structure and function, water clarity, open-source software development, fluid behavior, and more.

“In recent years, RPI’s research fairs have been virtual because of COVID,” said Jordanne Feldman, student services coordinator in the School of Science. “We wanted to do something in-person so the students could practice showcasing their work in a face-to-face setting. It’s also just more fun to get together, have some food, and mingle with other young professionals. We are so proud of the students and their accomplishments.”

At Rensselaer, undergraduate students are often offered opportunities to participate in research that typically only happens at the graduate level.
